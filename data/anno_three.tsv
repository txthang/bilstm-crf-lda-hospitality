a	O
5-star	O

Overall	O
I	O

The	O
breakfast	B-POS
was	O
good	O
!	O

The	O
only	O
fault	O
I	O
can	O
comment	O
on	O

that	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
returning	O
to	O
the	O
hotel	O
via	O
taxi	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
always	O
know	O
where	O
the	O
hotel	O
is	O
or	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
take	O
you	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
distance	O

Your	O

There	O
